# Automated Email Parser

This project is created using Node.js to showcase my skills in backend. 
- It uses Google OAuth 2.0 [Known as Open Authorization], which is a framework that allows users to authorize one application to access another without sharing their password.
- Next I've added Gmail API to automate reading mails, categorize them into different labels and for sending replies to reciepents.
- I've integrated Gemini 1.5 Flash AI model to parse the content of the mails and according to the context I've created logic for generating labels and replies.

## Future Scopes

Within 48 hours, I've been able to achieve this much. I had no prior knowledge of implementing OAuth, so it took me about a day to learn and implement that part. While all the requirements haven't been fulfilled yet, this is a functional project that supports Google OAuth and the Gmail API. 

- I'll be implement OAuth service for OutLook soon.
- I'll be implementing BullMQ for queuing messages.
- I'll be adding a frontend layout so users can interact with the app.

Thank You so much for your time and consideration!
